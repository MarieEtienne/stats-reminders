This chapter is a simple example using R

You can import R package using the code

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| label: include_tidyverse

library(tidyverse)
```


and then describe the purpose of your chapter as well as executing R command.

You can also add images 

![Gentoo penguins](images/6123849122_b66af201ea_c.jpg}

For example a basic summary of a dataset is given by 

```{r}
df <- read.table("https://gist.githubusercontent.com/slopp/ce3b90b9168f2f921784de84fa445651/raw/4ecf3041f0ed4913e7c230758733948bc561f434/penguins.csv", sep = "," , header = TRUE)
```

and produce a graph

```{r}
df %>% ggplot() +
	aes(x=species, y = body_mass_g) +
	geom_boxplot()  
```

Just for curiosity, you could add an image of Gentoo penguins

You can also add images 

![Gentoo penguins](images/6123849122_b66af201ea_c.jpg){#fig-gentoo}

You can refer to one image using cross-reference. For example,  @fig-gentoo is a photo of a gentoo penguin with chicks by Liam Quinn.



You can also add reference associated with models. For example, if you want to study how the body mass  differ between species you should use a one way analysis of variance as described in  @eq-onewayanova

$$Y_{sk} = \mu + \alpha_s + E_{sk},
$$ {#eq-onewayanova}

where $s$ standes for species and $k$ denotes each individual.
