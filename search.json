    "title": "GENERALIZED LINEAR MIXED MODEL",
    "section": "",
    "text": "We present here a reminder sheet on Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) and its specific features. Its use will be illustrated through a study applied on badgers from Walker et al. (2009) .\nRemark : the concepts covered are taken from our Master’s courses and tutorials, written and taught by AbelMasson (n.d.) and Outreman (n.d.) .\n\n\nGeneral Linear Models are used to describe the relationship between a continuous response \\(Y\\) and one or more explanatory variables \\(X_{1}\\),\\(X_{2}\\)…\\(X_{p}\\). They rely on three main assumptions : independence of residuals, normality of residuals and homogeneity of variances. However, in many cases, the response variable \\(Y\\) is discrete (for example, counts or binary outcomes).\nFor discrete responses, the variance of \\(Y\\) typically depends on its mean-variance relationship. As a result, the variance is not constant across observations, invalidating the assumption of homogeneity required by linear models. Moreover, fitting a General Linear Model to count data can lead to negative predicted values and non-normal residuals. In shorts, General Linear Models are not well-suited for discrete responses. Hence, we need specific tools to analyse discrete response data. These are Generalized Linear Models (GLMs).\n\n\n\nA GLM extends the classical linear model through three steps :\n\nAssumption of the distribution of the response variable \\(Y_{i}\\)\nThe specification of the systematic part; this is the linear function of the explanatory variables (the linear predictor called \\(\\eta\\))\nThe relationship between the mean value of \\(Y_{i}\\) and the systematic part. This is also called the link between the mean and the systematic part: the link function noted \\(g\\) .\n\nA Generalized Linear Model can be written as : \\[g(\\mu_{y})= \\alpha+ \\beta_{1}.X{i1}+ \\beta_{2}.X{i2}+\\beta_{3}.X{i3}+...\\beta_{p}.X{ip} = \\eta \\]\nThe linear predictor \\(\\eta\\), emerges from the linear model as a sum of the terms for each of the \\(p\\) parameters. This is not a value of \\(Y\\). The value of \\(\\eta\\) is obtained by transforming the value of \\(Y\\) by the link function, and the predicted value of \\(Y\\) is obtained by applying the inverse link function to \\(\\eta\\).\n\n\n\nDepending on the sampling design or the experimental set-up, independence of residuals is often not respected : some statistical units are related. To account for this dependence structure, we can include random effects in the model.\nThe resulting model, called Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) extends the GLM by adding these random effects alongside the fixed effects. Therefore, GLMMs allow us to model both the relationship between predictors and responses and the non-independence among observations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBadger picture from Scottish SPCA\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data used come from (Walker2009a?) and consist of signs of badger (Meles meles) activity around farms located in the southwest of England, where badger density is high. This study was carried out in the context of bovine tuberculosis and its possible transmission to cattle through badgers. Reducing the number of farm visits by badgers — especially in places where they might come into contact with livestock — could help limit the spread of the disease. Thus, the aim of this study is to predict the occurrence of badger activity signs on farms.\nBetween autumn 2003 and summer 2005, a survey was conducted on 36 different farms; the data are therefore longitudinal, since each farm was monitored over eight consecutive seasons. Within the same farm, observations may be temporally autocorrelated.\nThe response variable (presence or absence of signs of badger activity) is binary: it takes the value 1 when signs of activity were detected, and 0 otherwise. Signs of activity include the presence of feces, setts, or feeding traces.\nThe data are available in the file Badger.txt. The variables are:\n\nYear : studied year\nSeason : 1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = autumn, 4 = winter\nfarm_code_numeric : farm identifier\nSurvey : survey identifier (time indicator)\nSigns_in_yard : binary indicator of badger activity (response variable)\nNo_setts_in_fields : number of setts\nNo_active_setts_in_fields : number of actively occupied setts\nNo_buildings : number of buildings in the farm\nNo_cattle_in_buildings_yard : number of cattle in building yards\nAccessible_feed_store_present : presence / absence of an accessible feed store\nAccessible_cattle_house_present : presence / absence of a direct access to the cattle house\nAccessible_feed_present : presence / absence of accessible feed in the farm\nGrass_silage : presence / absence of grass silage\nCereal_silage : presence / absence of cereal silage\nHayStraw : presence / absence of hay and / or straw\nCereal_grains : presence / absence of cereal grains\nConcentrates : presence / absence of concentrates\nProteinblocks : presence / absence of protein blocks\nSugarbeet : presence / absence of sugar beet\nVegetables : presence / absence of vegetables\nMolasses : presence / absence of molasses :::\n\n\n\n\n\n# library import\nlibrary(corrplot)\n\ncorrplot 0.95 loaded\n\nlibrary(lme4)\n\nLoading required package: Matrix\n\nlibrary(rsq)\n\n\n# Dataset import\ndataBadger &lt;- read.table(\"Badger.txt\", dec=\".\", header = TRUE)\n\n# Reduce name and change categorical variables as factor\ndataBadger$Activity&lt;- dataBadger$signs_in_yard\ndataBadger$N_setts&lt;-dataBadger$N_setts_in_fields\ndataBadger$N_cattle&lt;-dataBadger$N_cattle_in_buildings_yard\ndataBadger$season&lt;-as.factor(dataBadger$season)\ndataBadger$feed_store&lt;-as.factor(dataBadger$accessible_feed_store_present)\ndataBadger$cattle_house&lt;-as.factor(dataBadger$accessible_cattle_house_present)\ndataBadger$feed&lt;-as.factor(dataBadger$accessible_feed_present)\ndataBadger$grass&lt;-as.factor(dataBadger$grass_silage)\ndataBadger$cereal&lt;-as.factor(dataBadger$cereal_silage)\ndataBadger$straw&lt;-as.factor(dataBadger$hay_straw)\ndataBadger$grains&lt;-as.factor(dataBadger$cereal_grains)\ndataBadger$concen&lt;-as.factor(dataBadger$concentrates)\ndataBadger$sugar&lt;-as.factor(dataBadger$sugar_beet)\ndataBadger$molasses&lt;-as.factor(dataBadger$molasses)\n\n# Check for presence of missing values\ncolSums(is.na(dataBadger))\n\n                             ID                            year \n                              0                               0 \n                         season                       farm_code \n                              0                               0 \n                         survey                   signs_in_yard \n                              0                               0 \n              N_setts_in_fields                     N_buildings \n                              0                               0 \n     N_cattle_in_buildings_yard   accessible_feed_store_present \n                              0                               0 \naccessible_cattle_house_present         accessible_feed_present \n                              0                               0 \n                   grass_silage                   cereal_silage \n                              0                               0 \n                      hay_straw                   cereal_grains \n                              0                               0 \n                   concentrates                      sugar_beet \n                              0                               0 \n                       molasses                        Activity \n                              0                               0 \n                        N_setts                        N_cattle \n                              0                               0 \n                     feed_store                    cattle_house \n                              0                               0 \n                           feed                           grass \n                              0                               0 \n                         cereal                           straw \n                              0                               0 \n                         grains                          concen \n                              0                               0 \n                          sugar \n                              0 \n\n# There is no missing value.\n\n\n\n\nBefore carrying out any statistical modeling, it is essential to perform a thorough data exploration. This step helps identify potential issues such as outliers, collinearity, or imbalanced distributions that could bias the results or invalidate model assumptions.\nBelow is a checklist of preliminary exploratory analyses to perform before modeling:\n\nCheck for outliers and distribution of the dependent variable ($Y$).\nCheck for outliers and distribution of the explicative variable ($X$). If $X$ is quantitative: assess the distribution and presence of outliers. If $X$ is qualitative: analyze the number of levels and the number of observations per level.\nExplore the potential relationships between $Y$ and each $X_i$.\nCheck for potential interactions between explanatory variables ($X_i$).\nAssess multicollinearity among the $X_i$ variables.\n\n\n\nSince $Y$ is a binary variable, it does not have a continuous distribution. Instead, we inspect the frequency of each category (0 and 1) to check for imbalance in the response variable.\n\n# Number of 0 and 1 in Y\ntable(dataBadger$Activity)\n\n\n  0   1 \n233  45 \n\n\n\n\n\nFor continuous independent variables, it is important to:\n\nDetect potential outliers (e.g., extreme or erroneous values)\nVisualize the shape of the distribution (e.g., normal, skewed, multimodal)\nAssess whether transformations (e.g., log, square root) might be needed before modeling\n\nThe following visualizations help achieve this:\n\nCleveland dot plots: to identify potential outliers\nHistograms: to visualize the overall distribution\nQ-Q plots: to assess normality assumptions\n\n\npar(mfrow=c(3,3))\n\n# Number of badger setts on farm\n# Cleveland plot\ndotchart(dataBadger$N_setts,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='Number of setts')\n# Histogram\nhist(dataBadger$N_setts,col='blue',xlab=\"Number of setts\",main=\"\")\n# Quantile-Quantile plot\nqqnorm(dataBadger$N_setts,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='')\nqqline(dataBadger$N_setts,col='red')\n\n# Number of buildings on farm\n# Cleveland plot\ndotchart(dataBadger$N_buildings,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='Number of buildings')\n# Histogram\nhist(dataBadger$N_buildings,col='blue',xlab=\"Number of buildings\",main=\"\")\n# Quantile-Quantile plot\nqqnorm(dataBadger$N_buildings,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='')\nqqline(dataBadger$N_buildings,col='red')\n\n# Number of cattle housed in buildings on farm\n# Cleveland plot\ndotchart(dataBadger$N_cattle,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='Number of cattle')\n# Histogram\nhist(dataBadger$N_cattle,col='blue',xlab=\"Number of cattle\",main=\"\")\n# Quantile-Quantile plot\nqqnorm(dataBadger$N_cattle,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='')\nqqline(dataBadger$N_cattle,col='red')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exploratory plots show that all three quantitative variables (number of setts, number of buildings, and number of cattle) display right-skewed distributions, with most farms having relatively low values and a few having much higher ones. No extreme or abnormal outliers are clearly visible, although some high values are present, especially for the number of cattle. The Q-Q plots confirm that none of these variables follow a normal distribution.\n\n\n\nFor categorical (factor) variables, it is important to examine the number of levels (categories) and the number of observations in each level. This helps identify potential issues such as:\n\nLevels with very few observations (which may cause estimation problems in statistical models)\nHighly unbalanced distributions between categories\nUnexpected or erroneous category labels\n\nThe following code summarizes the distribution of individuals across levels for each categorical predictor:\n\n# Factor season\nsummary(dataBadger$season)\n\n 1  2  3  4 \n70 67 69 72 \n\n# Factor feed_store\nsummary(dataBadger$feed_store)\n\n  0   1 \n 49 229 \n\n# Factor cattle_house \nsummary(dataBadger$cattle_house )\n\n  0   1 \n 91 187 \n\n# Factor feed\nsummary(dataBadger$feed)\n\n  0   1 \n 47 231 \n\n# Factor grass\nsummary(dataBadger$grass)\n\n  0   1 \n171 107 \n\n# Factor cereal\nsummary(dataBadger$cereal)\n\n  0   1 \n199  79 \n\n# Factor straw\nsummary(dataBadger$straw)\n\n  0   1 \n107 171 \n\n# Factor grains\nsummary(dataBadger$grains)\n\n  0   1 \n165 113 \n\n# Factor concen\nsummary(dataBadger$concen)\n\n  0   1 \n142 136 \n\n# Factor sugar\nsummary(dataBadger$sugar)\n\n  0   1 \n255  23 \n\n\nThe categorical variables show that most factors are binary, with varying levels of balance between categories. For example, variables such as feed_store, cattle_house, and feed display moderate imbalance, with one category being more frequent than the other. The season variable has four well-represented levels, each containing a similar number of observations, which ensures adequate variability for analysis. Overall, the categorical predictors appear suitable for modeling.\n\n\n\nTo gain preliminary insight into the relationships between the response variable (Activity) and the predictors, both quantitative and categorical variables were explored graphically.\nScatterplots were used to visualize how badger activity varies with continuous predictors such as the number of setts, number of buildings and number of cattle housed. These visual analyses provide a first impression of potential patterns, dependencies, or nonlinear relationships that may influence badger activity on farms.\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,3))\n# Number of setts\nplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$N_setts,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='Number of setts',ylab='Presence of a sign of badger activity')\n\n# Number of buildings\nplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$N_buildings,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='Number of buildings',ylab='Presence of a sign of badger activity')\n\n# Number of cattle housed in buildings\nplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$N_cattle,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='Number of cattle',ylab='Presence of a sign of badger activity')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,5))\n# Factor season\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$season\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & Season\")\n\n# Factor feed store\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$feed_store\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & Feed store\")\n\n# Factor cattle_house \nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$cattle_house\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & cattle house\")\n\n# Factor feed\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$feed\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & feed\")\n# Factor grass\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$grass\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & Grass\")\n# Factor cereal\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$cereal\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & Cereal\")\n# Factor straw\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$straw\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & Straw\")\n# Factor grains\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$grains\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & Grains\")\n# Factor concen\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$concen\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & Concentrates\")\n# Factor sugar\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$sugar\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & Sugar Beet\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese visual analyses provide an initial understanding of how badger activity may relate to farm characteristics. The scatterplots show that no clear linear relationship exists between badger activity and the number of setts, buildings, or cattle, although activity tends to occur slightly more often on farms with more setts or larger cattle numbers. The mosaic plots complement this by revealing possible associations between activity and certain categorical management factors, such as the presence of feed stores, cattle housing, or specific feeding practices.\n\n\n\nHere, given the large number of predictors, we will not include interactions in modelling\n\n\n\nTo avoid multicollinearity issues during modeling, the relationships among predictor variables were examined. This step includes:\n\nEvaluating correlations between the three quantitative variables\nAssessing potential overlap between categorical factors\nExploring whether categorical predictors influence quantitative ones through boxplots\n\nGiven the large number of predictors, only key results are summarized below.\n\n# Checking collinearity between the 3 quantitative independent variables\n\n# We represent plot for each X continuous covariate pairs\nplot(dataBadger[7:9],pch=16,col='blue')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#We calculate correlation between each pair of X covariate\nM&lt;-cor(dataBadger[7:9])\ncorrplot.mixed(M,upper=\"square\",lower.col=\"black\", tl.col=\"black\",cl.cex = 0.8,tl.cex = 0.7,number.cex =0.8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Checking collinearity between  categorical independent variables\n# produce all crossed tables between pairs of factors - not detailed here\n\n# Checking collinearity between categorical and quantitative independent variables\n# for each quantitative independent variable, use boxplot graphics to check whether factors influence it - not detailed here\n\nThe collinearity analysis indicates that the three quantitative variables are largely independent. A moderate positive correlation (r ≈ 0.52) is observed between the number of buildings and the number of cattle in the yard, suggesting a slight interdependence between these two variables. In contrast, the number of setts in fields shows almost no correlation with the others (r close to 0). Overall, no strong collinearity is detected, allowing these predictors to be retained for further modelling without major redundancy concerns.\n\n\n\n\nBecause the response variable is binary, we will use a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to examine how the different predictors influence badger activity. We assume that badger activity follows a binomial distribution, and we will therefore use a logit link function. The farm code is included as a random effect, to take into account the temporal autocorrelation between observations.\n\n\nThe best model is identified using a backward selection procedure. This model selection method is based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which allows to take into account both the goodness of fit and the simplicity of the model. Starting with the full model, the function drop1 is used to evaluate each predictor’s contribution to the AIC.

    "text": "The data used come from (Walker2009a?) and consist of signs of badger (Meles meles) activity around farms located in the southwest of England, where badger density is high. This study was carried out in the context of bovine tuberculosis and its possible transmission to cattle through badgers. Reducing the number of farm visits by badgers — especially in places where they might come into contact with livestock — could help limit the spread of the disease. Thus, the aim of this study is to predict the occurrence of badger activity signs on farms.\nBetween autumn 2003 and summer 2005, a survey was conducted on 36 different farms; the data are therefore longitudinal, since each farm was monitored over eight consecutive seasons. Within the same farm, observations may be temporally autocorrelated.\nThe response variable (presence or absence of signs of badger activity) is binary: it takes the value 1 when signs of activity were detected, and 0 otherwise. Signs of activity include the presence of feces, setts, or feeding traces.\nThe data are available in the file Badger.txt. The variables are:\n\nYear : studied year\nSeason : 1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = autumn, 4 = winter\nfarm_code_numeric : farm identifier\nSurvey : survey identifier (time indicator)\nSigns_in_yard : binary indicator of badger activity (response variable)\nNo_setts_in_fields : number of setts\nNo_active_setts_in_fields : number of actively occupied setts\nNo_buildings : number of buildings in the farm\nNo_cattle_in_buildings_yard : number of cattle in building yards\nAccessible_feed_store_present : presence / absence of an accessible feed store\nAccessible_cattle_house_present : presence / absence of a direct access to the cattle house\nAccessible_feed_present : presence / absence of accessible feed in the farm\nGrass_silage : presence / absence of grass silage\nCereal_silage : presence / absence of cereal silage\nHayStraw : presence / absence of hay and / or straw\nCereal_grains : presence / absence of cereal grains\nConcentrates : presence / absence of concentrates\nProteinblocks : presence / absence of protein blocks\nSugarbeet : presence / absence of sugar beet\nVegetables : presence / absence of vegetables\nMolasses : presence / absence of molasses :::"

    "text": "Before carrying out any statistical modeling, it is essential to perform a thorough data exploration. This step helps identify potential issues such as outliers, collinearity, or imbalanced distributions that could bias the results or invalidate model assumptions.\nBelow is a checklist of preliminary exploratory analyses to perform before modeling:\n\nCheck for outliers and distribution of the dependent variable ($Y$).\nCheck for outliers and distribution of the explicative variable ($X$). If $X$ is quantitative: assess the distribution and presence of outliers. If $X$ is qualitative: analyze the number of levels and the number of observations per level.\nExplore the potential relationships between $Y$ and each $X_i$.\nCheck for potential interactions between explanatory variables ($X_i$).\nAssess multicollinearity among the $X_i$ variables.\n\n\n\nSince $Y$ is a binary variable, it does not have a continuous distribution. Instead, we inspect the frequency of each category (0 and 1) to check for imbalance in the response variable.\n\n# Number of 0 and 1 in Y\ntable(dataBadger$Activity)\n\n\n  0   1 \n233  45 \n\n\n\n\n\nFor continuous independent variables, it is important to:\n\nDetect potential outliers (e.g., extreme or erroneous values)\nVisualize the shape of the distribution (e.g., normal, skewed, multimodal)\nAssess whether transformations (e.g., log, square root) might be needed before modeling\n\nThe following visualizations help achieve this:\n\nCleveland dot plots: to identify potential outliers\nHistograms: to visualize the overall distribution\nQ-Q plots: to assess normality assumptions\n\n\npar(mfrow=c(3,3))\n\n# Number of badger setts on farm\n# Cleveland plot\ndotchart(dataBadger$N_setts,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='Number of setts')\n# Histogram\nhist(dataBadger$N_setts,col='blue',xlab=\"Number of setts\",main=\"\")\n# Quantile-Quantile plot\nqqnorm(dataBadger$N_setts,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='')\nqqline(dataBadger$N_setts,col='red')\n\n# Number of buildings on farm\n# Cleveland plot\ndotchart(dataBadger$N_buildings,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='Number of buildings')\n# Histogram\nhist(dataBadger$N_buildings,col='blue',xlab=\"Number of buildings\",main=\"\")\n# Quantile-Quantile plot\nqqnorm(dataBadger$N_buildings,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='')\nqqline(dataBadger$N_buildings,col='red')\n\n# Number of cattle housed in buildings on farm\n# Cleveland plot\ndotchart(dataBadger$N_cattle,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='Number of cattle')\n# Histogram\nhist(dataBadger$N_cattle,col='blue',xlab=\"Number of cattle\",main=\"\")\n# Quantile-Quantile plot\nqqnorm(dataBadger$N_cattle,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='')\nqqline(dataBadger$N_cattle,col='red')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe exploratory plots show that all three quantitative variables (number of setts, number of buildings, and number of cattle) display right-skewed distributions, with most farms having relatively low values and a few having much higher ones. No extreme or abnormal outliers are clearly visible, although some high values are present, especially for the number of cattle. The Q-Q plots confirm that none of these variables follow a normal distribution.\n\n\n\nFor categorical (factor) variables, it is important to examine the number of levels (categories) and the number of observations in each level. This helps identify potential issues such as:\n\nLevels with very few observations (which may cause estimation problems in statistical models)\nHighly unbalanced distributions between categories\nUnexpected or erroneous category labels\n\nThe following code summarizes the distribution of individuals across levels for each categorical predictor:\n\n# Factor season\nsummary(dataBadger$season)\n\n 1  2  3  4 \n70 67 69 72 \n\n# Factor feed_store\nsummary(dataBadger$feed_store)\n\n  0   1 \n 49 229 \n\n# Factor cattle_house \nsummary(dataBadger$cattle_house )\n\n  0   1 \n 91 187 \n\n# Factor feed\nsummary(dataBadger$feed)\n\n  0   1 \n 47 231 \n\n# Factor grass\nsummary(dataBadger$grass)\n\n  0   1 \n171 107 \n\n# Factor cereal\nsummary(dataBadger$cereal)\n\n  0   1 \n199  79 \n\n# Factor straw\nsummary(dataBadger$straw)\n\n  0   1 \n107 171 \n\n# Factor grains\nsummary(dataBadger$grains)\n\n  0   1 \n165 113 \n\n# Factor concen\nsummary(dataBadger$concen)\n\n  0   1 \n142 136 \n\n# Factor sugar\nsummary(dataBadger$sugar)\n\n  0   1 \n255  23 \n\n\nThe categorical variables show that most factors are binary, with varying levels of balance between categories. For example, variables such as feed_store, cattle_house, and feed display moderate imbalance, with one category being more frequent than the other. The season variable has four well-represented levels, each containing a similar number of observations, which ensures adequate variability for analysis. Overall, the categorical predictors appear suitable for modeling.\n\n\n\nTo gain preliminary insight into the relationships between the response variable (Activity) and the predictors, both quantitative and categorical variables were explored graphically.\nScatterplots were used to visualize how badger activity varies with continuous predictors such as the number of setts, number of buildings and number of cattle housed. These visual analyses provide a first impression of potential patterns, dependencies, or nonlinear relationships that may influence badger activity on farms.\n\npar(mfrow=c(1,3))\n# Number of setts\nplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$N_setts,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='Number of setts',ylab='Presence of a sign of badger activity')\n\n# Number of buildings\nplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$N_buildings,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='Number of buildings',ylab='Presence of a sign of badger activity')\n\n# Number of cattle housed in buildings\nplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$N_cattle,pch=16,col='blue',xlab='Number of cattle',ylab='Presence of a sign of badger activity')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npar(mfrow=c(2,5))\n# Factor season\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$season\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & Season\")\n\n# Factor feed store\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$feed_store\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & Feed store\")\n\n# Factor cattle_house \nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$cattle_house\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & cattle house\")\n\n# Factor feed\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$feed\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & feed\")\n# Factor grass\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$grass\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & Grass\")\n# Factor cereal\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$cereal\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & Cereal\")\n# Factor straw\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$straw\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & Straw\")\n# Factor grains\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$grains\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & Grains\")\n# Factor concen\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$concen\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & Concentrates\")\n# Factor sugar\nmosaicplot(dataBadger$Activity~dataBadger$sugar\n           ,color=c('blue3','red2')\n           ,main=\"Activity & Sugar Beet\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese visual analyses provide an initial understanding of how badger activity may relate to farm characteristics. The scatterplots show that no clear linear relationship exists between badger activity and the number of setts, buildings, or cattle, although activity tends to occur slightly more often on farms with more setts or larger cattle numbers. The mosaic plots complement this by revealing possible associations between activity and certain categorical management factors, such as the presence of feed stores, cattle housing, or specific feeding practices.\n\n\n\nHere, given the large number of predictors, we will not include interactions in modelling\n\n\n\nTo avoid multicollinearity issues during modeling, the relationships among predictor variables were examined. This step includes:\n\nEvaluating correlations between the three quantitative variables\nAssessing potential overlap between categorical factors\nExploring whether categorical predictors influence quantitative ones through boxplots\n\nGiven the large number of predictors, only key results are summarized below.\n\n# Checking collinearity between the 3 quantitative independent variables\n\n# We represent plot for each X continuous covariate pairs\nplot(dataBadger[7:9],pch=16,col='blue')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#We calculate correlation between each pair of X covariate\nM&lt;-cor(dataBadger[7:9])\ncorrplot.mixed(M,upper=\"square\",lower.col=\"black\", tl.col=\"black\",cl.cex = 0.8,tl.cex = 0.7,number.cex =0.8)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Checking collinearity between  categorical independent variables\n# produce all crossed tables between pairs of factors - not detailed here\n\n# Checking collinearity between categorical and quantitative independent variables\n# for each quantitative independent variable, use boxplot graphics to check whether factors influence it - not detailed here\n\nThe collinearity analysis indicates that the three quantitative variables are largely independent. A moderate positive correlation (r ≈ 0.52) is observed between the number of buildings and the number of cattle in the yard, suggesting a slight interdependence between these two variables. In contrast, the number of setts in fields shows almost no correlation with the others (r close to 0). Overall, no strong collinearity is detected, allowing these predictors to be retained for further modelling without major redundancy concerns."

    "text": "Because the response variable is binary, we will use a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) to examine how the different predictors influence badger activity. We assume that badger activity follows a binomial distribution, and we will therefore use a logit link function. The farm code is included as a random effect, to take into account the temporal autocorrelation between observations.\n\n\nThe best model is identified using a backward selection procedure. This model selection method is based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which allows to take into account both the goodness of fit and the simplicity of the model. Starting with the full model, the function drop1 is used to evaluate each predictor’s contribution to the AIC. The predictor whose removal leads to the smallest AIC is then removed and the model is refitted without this variable.

variance, and the dependance in the data has already been taken into account with the random effect.

    "text": "GENERAL INTRODUCTION\nWe present here, a reminder sheet on the General Linear Model (GLM) and its specific features. Its use will be illustrated with an example applied to ecological data on penguins from Gorman (2014) .\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote : The concepts covered in this reminder sheet are taken from our Master’s lectures, written by Outreman (n.d.) and then taught by AbelMasson (n.d.) . During these courses, we learned how to explore data and then analyze it using this type of model.\n\n\n\n\nGeneralities\nThe objective of the GLM is to explain a dependent variable as a function of independent explanatory variables measured on statistical units from a sample of a population. This type of model is generally constructed as follows:\n\\[Y = β*X + ε\\]\n\\(Y\\) is the response (dependent) variable to be explained. \\(X\\) is an explanatory (independent) variable that can explain \\(Y\\). There can be several in the model. βi represents a coefficient, placed in front of the \\(X\\) variables, to measure their effect on the response variable. ε represents the errors in the model, i.e. what the model cannot explain.\n\n\nType of General Linear Model\nThere are three general types of linear models:\n\nLinear regression\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA)\nAnalysis of variance-covariance (ANCOVA)\n\nThey each have their own specific characteristics and depend on the nature of the independent variables \\(X\\), which can be quantitative or qualitative. The response variable \\(Y\\) is always quantitative.\nLinear regression is used when we want to determine whether a linear relationship exists between the response variable \\(Y\\) and one or more quantitative \\(X\\) variables (then called covariates).\nANOVA is used when the explanatory variables \\(X\\) are qualitative (then called factors). These qualitative \\(X\\) variables often have multiple categories (levels).\nANCOVA is used when we want to model the variable \\(Y\\) as a function of several \\(X\\) variables, which can be qualitative and quantitative.\nAnother important aspect to consider is that for this type of model to be valid, three conditions must be met:\n\nthe model residuals must follow a normal distribution\nhomoscedasticity (homogeneity of the variance of the residuals) must be respected\nthe residuals are independent\n\nThese conditions are systematically verified after modeling : the verification will be illustrated in the following example.\n\n\nData presentation and objectives\n\n\n\nAdelie Penguins from Petrel Island - Adelie Land - C. Cornec (IPEV/CNRS/CSM)\n\n\nIn this application example, we will use data from a study conducted by Dr. Kristen Gorman, who studied the physical characteristics of three species of penguins in the Palmer Archipelago in Antarctica. The data was collected on three islands of the archipelago in 2007, 2008, and 2009.\nThe researcher noted the following characteristics in the individuals studied:\n\nspecies = species of individuals, qualitative variables, 3 levels (Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap)\nsex = sex of individuals, qualitative variables, 2 levels (male, female)\nbill_length_mm = bill length, quantitative variable\nbill_depth_mm = bill depth, quantitative variable\nflipper_length_mm = flipper length, quantitative variable\nbody_mass_g = body mass, quantitative variable\n\nWe also have information about the year of measurement and the island where the individuals live. We decide not to focus on these variables while studying the model. Indeed, we choose to focus our study on biological and morphological characteristics.\nWe will try to answer the following question : Which quantitative and qualitative variables can explain the variation in penguin body_mass_g?\nIn this case, the response variable is body_mass_g, and the other variables are assumed to be explanatory variables. We want to model the variable \\(Y\\) as a function of several qualitative and quantitative variables, therefore we do an ANCOVA.\nThe model can be build like this : model &lt;- lm (body_mass_g ~ ..., data = penguins)\n\n\n\nDATA IMPORTATION\nFirstly, we need to import the data, explore it, and see if there are any NA values, outliers, and so on. The data is accessible via the package palmerpenguins by Horst, Hill, and Gorman (2020).\n\n# Data importation \nlibrary(palmerpenguins) \n\n\nAttaching package: 'palmerpenguins'\n\n\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:datasets':\n\n    penguins, penguins_raw\n\ndata(\"penguins\") \n\n# Change categorical variables as factor \npenguins$sex&lt;-as.factor(penguins$sex) \npenguins$species&lt;-as.factor(penguins$species)\nstr(penguins)\n\ntibble [344 × 8] (S3: tbl_df/tbl/data.frame)\n $ species          : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Adelie\",\"Chinstrap\",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ island           : Factor w/ 3 levels \"Biscoe\",\"Dream\",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...\n $ bill_length_mm   : num [1:344] 39.1 39.5 40.3 NA 36.7 39.3 38.9 39.2 34.1 42 ...\n $ bill_depth_mm    : num [1:344] 18.7 17.4 18 NA 19.3 20.6 17.8 19.6 18.1 20.2 ...\n $ flipper_length_mm: int [1:344] 181 186 195 NA 193 190 181 195 193 190 ...\n $ body_mass_g      : int [1:344] 3750 3800 3250 NA 3450 3650 3625 4675 3475 4250 ...\n $ sex              : Factor w/ 2 levels \"female\",\"male\": 2 1 1 NA 1 2 1 2 NA NA ...\n $ year             : int [1:344] 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 2007 ...\n\n\n\n\n          species            island    bill_length_mm     bill_depth_mm \n                0                 0                 2                 2 \nflipper_length_mm       body_mass_g               sex              year \n                2                 2                11                 0 \n\n\nfemale   male   NA's \n   165    168     11 \n\n\nThere are NA values in the dataset. 2 rows of the dataset contain missing values for all the studied variables, except species. Values are missing for the variable sex in 9 other rows. There are different ways to process NA values. In our case, we decide to delete the two rows with almost complete missing information. Then, an option would be to replace the other missing values for the sex variable by “unknown” to specify that we don’t know if the individual is a male or a female and to create a new level for this variable. However, with this option, the group in which the sex is unknown would be under-represented compared to male and female group. As it seems interesting to test if being a female or a male has an influence on the body mass of penguins, having rows where the sex of individuals is unknown is not really useful and could add noise to the analysis. Therefore, we finally decide to delete all rows with NA values in the dataset. Moreover, the rows that include NA values only represented around 3% of the dataset.\n\n\n          species            island    bill_length_mm     bill_depth_mm \n                0                 0                 0                 0 \nflipper_length_mm       body_mass_g               sex              year \n                0                 0                 0                 0 \n\n\nWe now have handled NA values and we can continue to explore the data before implementing the model to answer our question.\n\n\nDATA EXPLORATION\nExploring the dataset is always the first step before analysis and model creation. This step is essential for identifying the structure of the variables and checking for outliers, correlations, or unbalanced distributions, mainly for qualitative variable categories, and assumptions.\n\n1. Outliers and distribution of the dependent variable (\\(Y\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on the 3 first graphs (Boxplot, Cleveland plot and Histogram), it seems that there are no outliers in the \\(Y\\) variable body_mass_g. With the Q-Q plot, the data appears to follow a Gaussian distribution. However, \\(Y\\) normality is not a required assumption for our model. Keep in mind that we will need to check something about normality later on : the model residuals must follow a normal distribution in the case of a linear model.\n\n\n2. Outliers and Distributions of Quantitative Predictors (\\(X\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere appear to be no outliers for any of the quantitative variables.\nLet’s describe what we observe. From the Cleveland plot, for the bill length variable, we can observe two distinct clusters which might be related to sexual dimorphism. For the bill depth, 3 clusters are observed on the Cleveland Plot : this variable might be related to the difference of bill depth between species. For flipper length, the Cleveland plot also reveals three distinct clusters. All these variables seem to follow a Gaussian distribution. Visualizing the distributions of the quantitative \\(X\\) variables allows us to formulate hypotheses regarding species differences and sexual dimorphism.\n\n\n3. Number of Levels and Individuals per Level of Qualitative Predictors (\\(X\\))\n\n\n   Adelie Chinstrap    Gentoo \n      146        68       119 \n\n\nfemale   male \n   165    168 \n\n\nFor the species variable, Chinstrap is a bit under-represented in comparison to other species. We will keep the variable for the model as it may capture important differences between groups. For the sex variable, the number of observations is almost equivalent for the male and female groups.\n\n\n4. Analysis of the Potential Relationships Between \\(Y\\) and the \\(Xs\\)\nNow, we can explore the potential relationship between the response variable \\(Y\\) (body_mass_g) and the \\(Xs\\) variables. Keep in mind that this part of the analysis is based on graphs and doesn’t tell us if the relationships between variables are significant or not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere appears to be a positive linear relationship between body mass and other quantitative variables. A sexual dimorphism is observed : females tend to have a lower body mass than males. In addition, there may be species differences : Gentoo penguins appear to have higher body mass compared to Adelie and Chinstrap penguins, which have similar body mass measurements.\n\n\n5. Analysis of possible interactions between both independent variables\nThis section aims to check for potential interaction effects between the two qualitative variables. To do so, all combinations of their categories must be present in the data.\n\n\n           \n            female male\n  Adelie        73   73\n  Chinstrap     34   34\n  Gentoo        58   61\n\n\nAll categories are present and well balanced across the factors, allowing us to test for potential interactions between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMales appear to have a higher body mass than females for the three species. The difference between males and females may vary a little depending on the species. There may be a small interaction between the tow factors sex and species.\nThen, we also check for potential interactions between explanatory quantitative variables and explanatory qualitative variables, using the following graphs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObservations regarding possible interactions :\nBill length and sex : there is a possible interaction. For some values of bill length, body mass is higher for males than females but for some values the opposite is true and females have a higher body mass than males.\nBill length and species : there are three color clusters that do not appear to mix on the graph. Individuals of the Gentoo species appear to have a higher body mass than the other species, but sometimes slightly lower depending on bill length values. A small interaction is possible.\nBill depth and sex : there appears to be no interaction between bill depth and sex. The relation between body mass and bill depth is the same for males and females and males body mass is higher than females body mass.\nBill depth and species : there appears to be no interaction between bill depth and species. The relation between body mass and bill depth observed previously during the data exploration is the same and the Gentoo species still stands out in terms of body mass : individuals of the Gentoo species still appear to have a higher body mass than the other species.\nFlipper length and sex : there is a possible interaction. Body mass appears to increase with flipper length but for some values of flipper length, females can have a higher body mass than males.\nFlipper length and species : there appears to be no interaction between flipper length and species. The relation between body mass and bill length observed previously during the data exploration is the same regardless the species and the Gentoo species still stands out in terms of body mass, which remains higher than the body of the other species on the graph.\nThese are only observations. For the moment, we don’t know which interactions are significant. This will be tested afterwards.\n\n\n6. Check for Collinearity Between Predictors (\\(Xs\\))\nCollinearity must be avoided in modeling. Indeed, collinearity can affect the modeling and significance of variables in the model, therefore the conclusions of the study are affected. Let’s check how the explanatory variables are related.\n\n\ncorrplot 0.95 loaded\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis verification of collinearity between \\(Xs\\) revealed a positive correlation between Flipper Length and Bill Length. The coefficient is below the threshold of 0.7, so we will not exclude either of these variables.\nNote : In some cases, there may be a strong correlation between a specific variable and some other variables, with a high correlation coefficient (greater than 0.7, which is the threshold set in most cases). This situation can lead you to exclude this specific variable but you always need to justify your choice.\nConcerning the other variables : For bill length, bill depth and flipper length, we observe a small difference between males and females. It looks like Adelie penguins have a shorter bill length than to the two other species. It appears Gentoo penguins have a smaller bill depth and bigger flipper length than the other species.\n\n\n\nMODEL AND STATSTICAL ANALYSIS\nOnce the data exploration is done, we can focus on finding the model that is adapted to our study. First, we write a full model including all variables presented before and possible interactions between them. Then, the goal is to obtain a fitted model (candidate model) that we can analyze in order to identify the main effects on our response variable body_mass_g. This candidate model can be obtained thanks to a selection based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). After selection, the conditions of the linear model (i.e. independence of residuals, normality of residuals and homoscedasticity ) must be validated before making interpretations and conclusions.\nFirstly, let’s write the full model, including all variables and possible interactions.\n\nmod_penguins&lt;-lm(body_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm\n        + bill_depth_mm\n        + flipper_length_mm\n        + species\n        + sex\n        + sex : species\n        + sex : bill_length_mm\n        + sex : bill_depth_mm\n        + sex : flipper_length_mm\n        + species : bill_length_mm\n        + species : bill_depth_mm\n        + species : flipper_length_mm\n        , data=penguins)\n\n#We check for significance\ndrop1(mod_penguins,test=\"F\")\n\nSingle term deletions\n\nModel:\nbody_mass_g ~ bill_length_mm + bill_depth_mm + flipper_length_mm + \n    species + sex + sex:species + sex:bill_length_mm + sex:bill_depth_mm + \n    sex:flipper_length_mm + species:bill_length_mm + species:bill_depth_mm + \n    species:flipper_length_mm\n                          Df Sum of Sq      RSS    AIC F value  Pr(&gt;F)  \n&lt;none&gt;
