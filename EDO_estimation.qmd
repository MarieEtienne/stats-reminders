# Introduction

This document aims to be a presentation of a logistic growth simulation: from the data simulation to the estimation of the parameters.

The following document will thus be organized in two parts : the data simulation and the estimation of the parameters.

# Data Simulation

```{r}
# Parameters
time <- seq(0, 25, 0.25)
r <- 0.5
K <- 100
error <- 5
y0 <- 1

# Logistic growth function with error
logistic <- function(t, r, K, y0, error) {
  growth <- K / (1 + ((K - y0) / y0) * exp(-r * t))
  return(growth + rnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = error))  # Add random error
}

# Apply the logistic function over the time vector
y <- sapply(time, logistic, r = r, K = K, y0 = y0, error = error)

# Plot the result
plot(time, y, col = "blue", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Population", main = "Logistic Growth with Error")
```

# Estimation of the parameters

We have p parameters $\theta = (\theta_1,\theta_2,...,\theta_p)$.

## General theory

### Maximum likelihood

Likelihood corresponds to the probability of observing the data, knowing the parameters $\theta$. The likelihood function is as follows :
$$
L(\theta) = \prod_{i=1}^n f(x_i , \theta)
$$
In this function, $x_i$ corresponds to the observations and $f(x_i,\theta)$ corresponds to the probability density function of the random variable X.

The maximum likelihood method consists of determining the $\hat\theta$ which allows obtaining the highest possible likelihood value :
$$
\hat\theta = \arg\max_\theta L(\theta)
$$
If the errors of the data are independent and identically distributed, this method is equivalent to the least squares method :
$$
\hat{\theta} = \arg\max_{\theta} L(\theta) = \arg\min_{\theta} SCE(\theta)
$$
We prefer to work on the logarithm of the product $L(\theta)$ as it converts products into sums :
$$
LL(\theta) = ln(L(\theta)) = \sum_{i=1}^n lnf(x_i,\theta)
$$
