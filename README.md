Welcome to **Stats Reminders**! ðŸŽ“  

This repository is a collaborative space for students in the **Open Reproducible Resources (OCR) 2025** course to create and share **concise reminders of basic statistical or mathematical concepts** as an exercise to practice reproducible science

Itâ€™s designed to help you practice **reproducible science skills**, including:  
- Using **Git and GitHub** for version control  
- Writing **Markdown** for clear, readable documentation  
- Organizing simple **statistical/mathematical  explanations, formulas, and examples**  

It will also served as sandbox during the lectures. Therefore the git history might be a bit fuzzy.


## Repository Structure

Choose 3 main themes, for exemple Around Differential Equation, Around Factorial Analysis  and Around Linear Models

Each student choses a theme and devotes to produce a relvant example of how the specific method could be used to build ecological knowledge from a dataset.

Quarto files (`.qmd`) which contains 
- a **short stats/math reminders**  
- data presenation with  **plots, tables, or small example datasets**
- and references ussing markdown format
- **explicit ecological results** obtained thanks to the method of interest
